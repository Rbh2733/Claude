## Tier 1 (Core) - Complete Implementation

### Composite Formula
```
COMPOSITE = (V × 0.20) + (Q × 0.30) + (G × 0.30) + (M × 0.10) + (FH × 0.10)
```

### Valuation Score (20% weight)

**Component 1: P/E Ratio (35% of Valuation)**
```python
Formula: Raw Score = 100 - [(Current P/E / Historical Avg P/E) - 1] × 100
Capped at 100 maximum

If Current P/E < Historical Avg P/E:
    Score = 100 (capped)
Else:
    Score = 100 - ((Current / Historical - 1) × 100)
```

**Component 2: FCF Yield (30% of Valuation)**
```python
FCF Yield = (TTM Free Cash Flow / Market Cap) × 100

Brackets:
  >6% = 100 points
  4-6% = 80 points
  2-4% = 60 points
  0-2% = 40 points
  <0% = 20 points
```

**Component 3: PEG Ratio (35% of Valuation)**
```python
PEG = Forward P/E / Expected EPS Growth Rate

Brackets:
  <1.0 = 100 points
  1.0-1.5 = 85 points
  1.5-2.0 = 70 points
  2.0-2.5 = 50 points
  >2.5 = 30 points
```

**Calculation:**
```python
Valuation Score = (PE_Score × 0.35) + (FCF_Score × 0.30) + (PEG_Score × 0.35)
```

### Quality Score (30% weight)

**Component 1: ROIC (30% of Quality)**
```python
ROIC = NOPAT / Invested Capital

Brackets:
  >25% = 100 points
  20-25% = 90 points
  15-20% = 75 points
  10-15% = 50 points
  <10% = 25 points

Note: Uses ROE as proxy if ROIC not available
```

**Component 2: Operating Margin (20% of Quality)**
```python
Op Margin = (Operating Income / Revenue) × 100

Brackets:
  >30% = 100 points
  20-30% = 85 points
  15-20% = 70 points
  10-15% = 50 points
  <10% = 30 points
```

**Component 3: Op Margin Trend (15% of Quality)**
```python
Margin Change (bps/year) = [(Current Margin - 3Yr Avg Margin) / 3] × 10,000

Brackets:
  >300 bps/year = 100 points
  150-300 bps/year = 85 points
  <150 bps/year = 70 points
  ±50 bps/year (stable) = 60 points
  Declining = 25 points
```

**Component 4: Competitive Moat (15% of Quality)**
```python
Base Score = 50 (neutral moat)

Bonuses (stack, cap at +25):
  Network Effects = +20
  Economies of Scale = +15
  Switching Costs = +15
  Intangible Assets = +10

Final Score = Base + Bonuses (capped at 100 total)
```

**Component 5: Management Execution (10% of Quality)**
```python
Earnings Beat Rate = (Beats in Last 12Q / 12) × 100

Brackets:
  >80% = 100 points (with bonuses capped)
  70-80% = 90 points
  60-70% = 80 points
  <60% = 70 points
```

**Component 6: Cash Conversion (10% of Quality)**
```python
Cash Conversion Ratio = Free Cash Flow / Net Income

Brackets:
  >1.2 = 100 points (efficient conversion)
  1.0-1.2 = 80 points
  0.8-1.0 = 60 points
  <0.8 = 30 points
```

**Calculation:**
```python
Quality Score = (ROIC×0.30) + (OpMarg×0.20) + (OpTrend×0.15) +
                (Moat×0.15) + (Mgmt×0.10) + (CashConv×0.10)
```

### Growth Score (30% weight)

**Component 1: Revenue Growth (30% of Growth)**
```python
3Yr Revenue CAGR = (Ending Revenue / Beginning Revenue)^(1/3) - 1

Brackets:
  >25% = 100 points
  20-25% = 90 points
  15-20% = 75 points
  10-15% = 55 points
  5-10% = 35 points
  <5% = 15 points
```

**Component 2: Growth Acceleration (15% of Growth)**
```python
Delta = Recent Growth - Historical Growth

Bonus Scoring:
  Delta >5% = 85 points (base 65 + 20 bonus)
  Delta 2-5% = 75 points (base 65 + 10 bonus)
  Delta ≈0% = 65 points (stable)
  Delta -2 to -5% = 55 points
  Delta < -5% = 50 points (decelerating)
```

**Component 3: EPS Growth (25% of Growth)**
```python
3Yr EPS CAGR = (Ending EPS / Beginning EPS)^(1/3) - 1

Brackets:
  >30% = 100 points
  20-30% = 85 points
  15-20% = 70 points
  10-15% = 50 points
  <10% = 30 points

Quality Check:
  If EPS CAGR >> Revenue CAGR → Operating Leverage (good)
  If EPS CAGR << Revenue CAGR → Margin Compression (bad)
```

**Component 4: Future Growth Potential (15% of Growth)**
```python
TAM Assessment:
  >$500B TAM + <20% market share = Base 100
  $200-500B TAM + <30% share = Base 85
  <$200B or >40% share = Base 50

Bonuses:
  Geographic expansion opportunity = +5
  New product cycles launching = +10
  Platform effects developing = +5

Total = Base + Bonuses (cap at 100)
```

**Component 5: Analyst Consensus (15% of Growth)**
```python
Forward Revenue Growth Estimate = Consensus average of analyst 1Y estimates

Brackets:
  >20% = 100 points
  15-20% = 80 points
  10-15% = 60 points
  <10% = 40 points
```

**Calculation:**
```python
Growth Score = (RevGrowth×0.30) + (Accel×0.15) + (EPSGrowth×0.25) +
               (FutureGrowth×0.15) + (Consensus×0.15)
```

### Momentum Score (10% weight)

**Component 1: 12-Month Price Return (40% of Momentum)**
```python
Return = [(Current Price - Price 12mo ago) / Price 12mo ago] × 100

Brackets:
  >40% = 100 points
  20-40% = 80 points
  0-20% = 60 points
  -10 to 0% = 40 points
  <-10% = 60 points (oversold recovery play)
```

**Component 2: Relative Strength vs QQQ (35% of Momentum)**
```python
Relative Performance = Stock Return - QQQ Return

Brackets:
  Outperform >15% = 100 points
  Outperform 0-15% = 75 points
  Underperform 0-15% = 50 points
  Underperform >15% = 30 points
```

**Component 3: Technical Setup (25% of Momentum)**
```python
Price vs Moving Averages:

Brackets:
  Above both 50-day & 200-day MA, trending up = 100 points
  Above 200-day only = 70 points
  Between 50 & 200 = 50 points
  Below both = 30 points
```

**Calculation:**
```python
Momentum Score = (Return×0.40) + (RelStrength×0.35) + (Technical×0.25)
```

### Financial Health Score (10% weight)

**Component 1: Net Cash Position (50% of FH)**
```python
Net Cash = Cash + Marketable Securities - Total Debt

Brackets (for mega-caps):
  >$50B net cash = 100 points
  $25-50B = 90 points
  $0-25B = 80 points
  Net debt <$50B = 70 points
  Net debt >$50B = 50 points

For smaller companies: Scale to market cap
Ratio = Net Cash / Market Cap
If >15% of market cap = 100 points
```

**Component 2: FCF Generation (40% of FH)**
```python
FCF as % of Revenue:
  >15% = 100 points
  10-15% = 80 points
  5-10% = 60 points
  <5% = 40 points
```

**Component 3: Capital Allocation (10% of FH)**
```python
Bonus Structure (stack, cap at +20):
  Buybacks + R&D >10% of revenue = +15
  Value-creating M&A track record = +10
  Growing dividend = +5

Base Score = 50
Final = Base + Bonuses (cap at 100 total)
```

**Calculation:**
```python
Financial Health Score = (NetCash×0.50) + (FCFGen×0.40) + (CapAlloc×0.10)
```

### Position Sizing Formula

```python
Position Size = (Base × Score/100) / (1 + (Beta - 1) × Risk Factor)

Where:
  Base = 10% starting allocation for Tier 1
  Score = Composite score 0-100
  Beta = Stock volatility vs market
  Risk Factor = 0.8 (conservative for core holdings)

Example (GOOGL):
  Composite = 79.1
  Beta = 1.1
  Position = (10% × 0.791) / (1 + (1.1 - 1) × 0.8)
  Position = 7.91% / 1.08
  Position = 7.3%

Tier 1 Guidelines:
  Maximum position: 15%
  Minimum score to hold: 65+
  Target 4-6 positions: 30-50% combined
```

## Tier 2 (Emerging) - Weight Differences

```
COMPOSITE = (V × 0.18) + (Q × 0.25) + (G × 0.35) + (M × 0.15) + (SM × 0.07)

Key Differences from Tier 1:
- Growth gets HIGHEST weight (35%)
- New component: Scale & Moat (7%)
- More lenient valuation standards
- Focus on revenue growth >25%
- Base position: 6% (max 8%)
- Risk Factor: 1.2 (higher volatility accepted)
```

## Tier 3 (Moonshots) - Weight Differences

```
COMPOSITE = (V × 0.10) + (Q × 0.15) + (G × 0.45) + (M × 0.20) + (D × 0.10)

Key Differences from Tier 1/2:
- Growth gets MASSIVE weight (45%)
- Valuation LOWEST weight (10%)
- New component: Disruption Potential (10%)
- Hypergrowth focus (>50%)
- Base position: 3% (max 3%)
- Risk Factor: 1.5 (high volatility)
- MANDATORY stop loss: -40%
```

## Implementation Details

### Data Sources

The `enhanced_stock_scorer.py` fetches data from Yahoo Finance:

```python
- Valuation: forward_pe, peg_ratio, price_to_sales
- Profitability: roe, roic, operating_margins, gross_margins
- Growth: revenue_growth, earnings_growth
- Financial: free_cash_flow, total_cash, total_debt
- Market: price, beta, moving averages (50-day, 200-day)
- Returns: Historical price data for 12M, 6M, 3M returns
```

### Limitations & Manual Inputs

Some metrics require manual assessment or are not available via Yahoo Finance:

**Manual Assessment Required:**
- Historical average P/E (use Macrotrends or calculate manually)
- Operating margin trend (need 3 years of quarterly data)
- Competitive moat assessment (qualitative)
- Earnings beat rate (track from earnings reports)
- TAM and market share estimates (from company presentations)
- Net Revenue Retention (for SaaS - from earnings)
- Disruption potential (qualitative assessment)

**Workarounds in Code:**
- Uses ROE as proxy for ROIC
- Uses current YoY growth as proxy for 3-year CAGR
- Provides default scores for manual metrics
- Uses heuristics for moat assessment based on symbol

### Usage Examples

#### Using Enhanced Scorer with Real Data
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install yfinance pandas numpy

# Run with real-time data
python3 enhanced_stock_scorer.py

# Test specific stocks (edit watchlist.json)
python3 auto_stock_rater.py
```

#### Using Formula Demo (No Dependencies)
```bash
# Run demonstration with mock data
python3 formula_demo.py

# Shows complete calculation breakdown
# Validates all formulas work correctly
```

#### Integrating into Your Code
```python
from enhanced_stock_scorer import StockDataFetcher, Tier1Scorer

# Fetch data
fetcher = StockDataFetcher()
data = fetcher.get_stock_data('GOOGL')

# Calculate scores
scores = Tier1Scorer.calculate_composite_score(data)

# Access results
print(f"Composite Score: {scores['composite_score']}")
print(f"Rating: {scores['rating']}")
print(f"Target Position: {scores['target_position_size']}%")
```

## Validation

The formula demonstration (`formula_demo.py`) validates the implementation:

**GOOGL Example Results:**
- Valuation Score: 83.5 ✓
- Quality Score: 87.8 ✓
- Growth Score: 60.2 ✓
- Momentum Score: 83.2 ✓
- Financial Health: 96.5 ✓
- **Composite: 79.1** ✓ (Buy rating)
- **Position Size: 7.3%** ✓

These results match the expected calculations from the formula specification.
